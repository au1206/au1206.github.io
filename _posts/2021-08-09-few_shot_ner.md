## Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition: A Comprehensive Study ##

A lesser-known albeit important paper in my opinion. This paper highlights a key problem in the industry that does not always appear in research making it all the more impressive.
In this paper, the authors talk about the problem of less data for NER in industry and experimentally try the effects of three key approaches on few-shot NER:

- Meta-Learning: Construct prototypes for different entities
- Supervised pre-training on huge noisy data
- Self Training


Please feel free to read along with the paper with my notes and highlights.
