## MLP-MIXER: An all MLP Architecture for Vision ##

This is a very recent paper that challenges the need for complicated transformer-based models for huge datasets and questions the inductive biases presently in place for the present image recognition tasks. 

This paper argues that given a huge dataset (size 100M+), the performance of traditional CNN-based architectures or the new transformer-based architectures are only marginally better than a classic MLP based architecture, thus questioning the inductive biases of both CNNs and Transformers for images.


Please feel free to read along with the paper with my notes and highlights.
