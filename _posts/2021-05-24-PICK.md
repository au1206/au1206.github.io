##  PICK: Processing Key Information Extraction from Documents using Improved Graph Learning-Convolutional Networks  ##

This paper talks KIE(Key Information Extraction), which is to extract texts of a number of key fields from given documents, and save the texts to structured documents. It proposes a solution which overcomes the existing problems fully and efficiently exploiting both textual and visual features of documents to get a richer semantic representation that is crucial for extraction.


Please feel free to read along the paper with my notes and highlights.
