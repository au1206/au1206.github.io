## Fastformer: Additive Attention Can Be All You Need ##

 Of late this paper is all the rage with its claims to introduce an attention mechanism that has a linear time complexity with respect to the sequence length. Why is this such a big deal you ask? Well, If you are familiar with transformers, one of the biggest downsides is the quadratic complexity which creates a huge bottleneck for longer sequences. So if additive attention works out, we will no longer have a strict cap of 512 tokens as introduced in the original and subsequent transformer-based architectures. This paper compares itself with other well-known efficient transformer techniques and conducts experiments on five well-known datasets.
