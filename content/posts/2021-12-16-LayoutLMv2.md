## LayoutLMv2: Multi-Modal Pre-Training For Visually-Rich Document Understanding ##

Microsoft delivers again with LayoutLMv2 to further mature the field of document understanding. The new pre-training tasks, the spatial aware self-attention, and the fact that image information is integrated into the pre-training stage itself distinguish this paper from its predecessor LayouLM and establish a new state-of-the-art performance for six widely used datasets in different tasks. This takes a step further in understanding documents through visual cues along with the textual content and layout information through a multi-modal model approach and carefully integrates Image, text, and layout information in the new self-attention mechanism.
