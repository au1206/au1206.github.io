## BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding ##

![png](/images/BERT.png)


The revolutionary paper by Google that increased the State-of-the-art performance for various NLP tasks and
set the stepping stone for many other revolutionary architectures.

This paper leads the way and sets a direction for the entire domain. It shows clear benefits of using 
pre-trained models(trained on huge datasets) and transfer learning independent of the downstream tasks.


Please feel free to read along with the paper with my notes and highlights.

| Color | Meaning |
| :---: | :--- | 
| Green | Topics about the current paper |
| Yellow | Topics about other relevant references |
| Blue | Implementation details/ maths/experiments |
| Red | Text including my thoughts, questions, and understandings | 

I have added the architectural details, my insights on the transformer architecture 
and some idea about positional embeddings in the end.
